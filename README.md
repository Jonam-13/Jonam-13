## Hello Everyone, Jonam Here ðŸ‘‹
<p>I am a computer science student currently in first year. I am trying to learn new things and gaining experience. I am currently focusing on Java and Python as per our first year course. I am interested in AI, robotices and app development but don't know how to and am lost so I want to join  Developers' Community Core Team to get guides, experiences and weant to know how standard software engineering methodologies and projects are managed in a real-world company.<br><br>
 I know this is not much of an introduction but I hope you find this interesting or something like that.
 </p>
